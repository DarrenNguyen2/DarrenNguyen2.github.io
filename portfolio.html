        <h2>Description of the Game</h2>
        <p>The objective of the game is to maneuver around the bullet bills and<br>
        other obstacles that appear on the screen. The scoring system that's <br>
        implemented into the game is that when you manage to kill the bullet<br>
        bills, you earn points. The use of randomness occurs for the spawntime<br>
        of the bullet bills and fireballs. The game is difficult to begin with<br>
        and it gets exponentially harder as you progress. The game ends if you <br>
        touch the bullet bills, fireballs, or if you beat the game. When you <br>
        lose, the screen switches to a another screen that tells you that you <br>
        died. It also plays a sound to let you know that you died.</p>
        <h2>Reflection on the game</h2>
        <p>I made this game in order to challenge people because I feel like <br>
        games should be difficult and not easy and mundane. I wanted to create <br>
        excitement or frustration in the player because of how they felt if they<br>
        were to beat the game or when they died. An inspiration for the game would<br>
        most likely be the Dark Souls Trilogy from FromSoftware. This is because<br>
        those games are known for their high level of difficulty. Two successful<br>
        points during the development of my game was getting the boss fight to <br>
        work properly and to get the shooting mechanic during the boss fight to<br> 
        work properly. Some obstacles that I ran into while developing the game <br>
        was figuring out how to get the fireballs to go where the mouse pointer clicked.<br>
        This was because the fireballs would shoot, but the fireballs glided across<br>
        the screen rather to go to where you clicked. I solved this by making a sprite<br>
        that was a dot and made the fireball point towards that sprite. That solved <br>
        the problem, surprisingly. Another problem I ran into was getting the lag<br>
        to disappear. I found out there was lag while you played the game was because<br>
        there were so many sprites on the screen that it caused the game to lag<br>
        and potentially freeze. I solved this by making one of the sprites delete<br>
        the other sprites if they were touching each other. If I had more time <br>
        to work on the game, I'd add more powerups to make the game more interesting <br>
        and fun. I'd also make it harder somehow.</p>
        <img src="scratchalgorithm.PNG">
        <p>The picture above is an algorithm in the game that plays heavily in
        removing the lag in the game. How it works is that when the bullet bills
        clone themselves, they create duplicates at a very fast rate.<br> Because of that,
        there are too many bullet bills filling up the screen to a point where Scratch
        can't handle that amount or will lag or freeze.<br> So this code solves the problem by
        making it so that if the clones touch each other, they'll delete themselves in order
        to clear up space.</p>
