        <h2>Description of the Game</h2>
        <p>The objective of the game is to maneuver around the bullet bills and<br>
        other obstacles that appear on the screen. The scoring system that's <br>
        implemented into the game is that when you manage to kill the bullet<br>
        bills, you earn points. The use of randomness occurs for the spawntime<br>
        of the bullet bills and fireballs. The game is difficult to begin with<br>
        and it gets exponentially harder as you progress. The game ends if you <br>
        touch the bullet bills, fireballs, or if you beat the game. When you <br>
        lose, the screen switches to a another screen that tells you that you <br>
        died. It also plays a sound to let you know that you died.</p>
        <h2>Reflection on the game</h2>
        <p>I made this game in order to challenge people because I feel like <br>
        games should be difficult and not easy and mundane. I wanted to create <br>
        excitement or frustration in the player because of how they felt if they<br>
        were to beat the game or when they died. An inspiration for the game would<br>
        most likely be the Dark Souls Trilogy from FromSoftware. This is because<br>
        those games are known for their high level of difficulty. Two successful<br>
        points during the development of my game was getting the boss fight to <br>
        work properly and to get the shooting mechanic during the boss fight to<br> 
        work properly. Some obstacles that I ran into while developing the game <br>
        was figuring out how to get the fireballs to go where the mouse pointer clicked.<br>
        This was because the fireballs would shoot, but the fireballs glided across<br>
        the screen rather to go to where you clicked. I solved this by making a sprite<br>
        that was a dot and made the fireball point towards that sprite. That solved <br>
        the problem, surprisingly. Another problem I ran into was getting the lag<br>
        to disappear. I found out there was lag while you played the game was because<br>
        there were so many sprites on the screen that it caused the game to lag<br>
        and potentially freeze. I solved this by making one of the sprites delete<br>
        the other sprites if they were touching each other. If I had more time <br>
        to work on the game, I'd add more powerups to make the game more interesting <br>
        and fun. I'd also make it harder somehow.</p>
        <img src="scratchalgorithm.PNG">
        <p>The picture above is an algorithm in the game that plays heavily in <br>
        removing the lag in the game. How it works is that when the bullet bills<br>
        clone themselves, they create duplicates at a very fast rate. Because of<br> 
        that, there are too many bullet bills filling up the screen to a point<br> 
        where Scratch can't handle that amount or will lag or freeze. So this <br>
        code solves the problem by making it so that if the clones touch each other,<br> 
        they'll delete themselves in order to clear up space.</p>

        <h1 id ="BokunoHero">Boku no Hero Academia</h1>
        <p>Our story that me and my friend created was loosely based on the manga with the same name<br> 
         by Kohei Horikoshi. It's about a boy named Deku who lives in a world full of superheroes.<br>
        These superheroes have powers called quirks. Unfortunately, Deku is quirkless,<br> 
        meaning he doesn't have any superpowers. One day he meets All Might, the strongest<br> 
        superhero, and he offers Deku to become his successor. You can either take<br>
        up the offer or not. The choices that proceed are based on your decisions.</p>

        <h2>Development Process</h2>
        <p>The iterative processes in our program was that the program allowed<br>
        users to make the decisions in the game by inputting the letters y and n and the capital<br> 
        versions of the letters. The program would also not continue if the user were<br> 
        to type in the wrong input. The program would present them with a message<br> 
        that said they put in an invalid input. It would then ask them to type in<br> 
        the right input, which was y or n. The incremental processes of our program<br>
        was that we created functions that acted as scenes. Functions allowed it so<br>
        that we could organize our code and to make sure the correct scenes play<br>
        based on the user's decisions. A minor problem that we ran into while<br>
        creating this game was that some scenes weren't playing despite the user<br>
        putting in the right input. We later found out that it was because when we<br>
        called the function, we spelled the function wrong.</p>
        <h2>Procedural Abstraction</h2>
        <p>Organizing our scenes into functions is a form of procedural abstraction<br>
        because it made it easier for me and my partner to locate a specific scene<br>
        and that we didn't have to keep typing lines of codes. The functions made it so<br>
        the lines of code would be compressed to just a word that we could call.<br>
        This worked efficiently and saved us lots of time while we were creating the game.</p>
        <h2>Shoutout</h2>
        <p>I like to give a shoutout to Brady Truong and Anthony Nguyen for making<br>
        Batman's Trilogy. Their game was hilarious and was very unexpected.</p>
